# signup-form
An HTML/CSS-only sign-up form with customized styling based on field status. 100% made on Flexbox.

Further validations can be made with JavaScript, such as custom invalid input popup messages, form submission canceling, among other rich features.

The intent of this project is to show what is possible to be done with HTML and CSS alone.
